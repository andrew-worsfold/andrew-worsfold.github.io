Today I've launched not only this new Jekyll-powered website, but a WordPress plugin called [Tailor](http://gettailor.com).  Tailor is a frontend page builder that allows for quick and easy layout creation using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface.  It's completely free, so if you're interested in creating a website using WordPress and would like to create cool layouts using your favourite theme without the need for custom code then give it a shot!

You can find Tailor on the [WordPress plugin repository](http://wordpress.org/plugins/tailor/) and as an open source project on [GitHub](http://github.com/andrew-worsfold/tailor/).  Feel free to share your thoughts of the plugin with my on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/andrewjworsfold/)!
