The latest version of the [Tailor page builder](http://www.gettailor.com) for WordPress (1.1.3) aligns the device preview and media query functionality of the plugin with that of the WordPress Customizer.

## Device previews

Choose from one of three device sizes to preview your page in that size:

1. Desktop
2. Tablet
3. Mobile

## Responsive settings

These sizes are now also used in the settings for certain elements.  For example, you can specify the minimum screen size that columns within a row should be displayed as columns (instead of being stacked on top of one another).
